## Responsibilities

🔧 What is the responsibility of “Operations”?

- Infrastructure management
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring & logging
- Reliability, scaling
- Incident response
- Production support

👩‍🔬 What about Testers / QA?

Testers or QA (Quality Assurance) are typically part of:
- Quality Engineering
- Release validation
- Automated test pipelines
- Manual and exploratory testing
- Performance testing

They often sit closer to the Development side.

### 🧾 What Can Be in a Team Agreement?

Here’s a breakdown of common areas:

- Communication
    - We respond to Slack messages within 4 working hours.
    - We avoid meetings before 10 AM.
    - We prefer camera ON in retros, OFF in daily standups.

- Collaboration & Feedback
    - We review pull requests within 1 day.
    - We give feedback respectfully and early — not just during retros.
    - We always pair on complex stories.

- Coding & Tech Practices
    - We write unit tests before merging.
    - We don’t merge without 1 peer review.
    - We use feature toggles for incomplete features.

- Decision Making
    - We use voting or silent brainstorming for big tech decisions.
    - We rotate who runs the daily standup.

- Meetings & Rituals
    - We keep meetings time-boxed.
    - Everyone should feel safe skipping non-critical meetings.

- Psychological Safety / Culture
    - No blame — mistakes are shared learning.
    - It’s OK to say “I don’t know.”
    - We value curiosity over perfection.

- Work Hours & Availability
    - We respect work-life boundaries.
    - We use Slack status to show availability.
    - We don’t expect anyone to work after 5 unless pre-agreed.

- Conflict Resolution
    - We address tension early, 1-on-1 first.
    - If needed, we involve a neutral third party (e.g., Scrum Master).
