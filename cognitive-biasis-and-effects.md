# Cognitive biasis and effects

Cognitive biases shape the way we think and often distort our thinking processes, leading to less-than-optimal decisions. Understanding these biases helps improve critical thinking and decision-making.

#### Few of the most popular ones

**Dunning-Kruger effect** – People with low ability at a task overestimate their ability, while experts tend to underestimate theirs.
**Confirmation bias** – The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.
**Availability heuristic** – Overestimating the importance or frequency of information that comes easily to mind.
**Anchoring effect** – Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the “anchor”) when making decisions.
**Bandwagon effect** – The tendency to do (or believe) things because many others do the same.
**Cognitive dissonance** – The discomfort experienced when holding two or more conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes.
**Sunk cost fallacy** – Continuing a behavior or endeavor due to previously invested resources (time, money, effort), even if it’s irrational.
**Fundamental attribution error** – Overemphasizing personality-based explanations for others’ behavior and underestimating situational factors.
**Overconfidence effect** – Being too confident in one’s abilities, knowledge, or predictions — more than is objectively justified.
**Self-serving bias** – Attributing successes to oneself and failures to external factors.
